# Three-Sisters-Hotel
This project is to build a website for the imaginary Three Sisters Hotel that is going to serve the Blue Mountains area, after the Covid-19 pandemic is possibly under control by the end of this year. This website should allow customers to search and book rooms, and allow administrators to manage bookings and view statistics, etc.
